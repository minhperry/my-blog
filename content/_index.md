I'm Minh, a Vietnamese student currently studying in [Dortmund, Germany](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dortmund).

This is just my personal blog site where I share my findings, experiences and my general interests which spans around Web & Software Dev, Open Source, Linux, Rhythm Gaming and Minecraft. Or maybe more, I dunno.
